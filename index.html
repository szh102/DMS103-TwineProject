        This is a college student daily routine simulation game. <br>
        There are many things you can't control in your life. So this simulation game consist of many randomized variables. <br>
        Therefore, most of the stories are based on random events that the system generate, but these event will affect your mood. <br>
        At the end of the day, you'll write a diary, that will reflect your mood score of the day. <br>
        If the score is higher than 5, you have a generally good day. <br>
        If the score is lower than 5, you had a bad day, sorry about that, but that's life...
